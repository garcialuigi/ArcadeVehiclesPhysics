# ArcadeVehiclesPhysics

Custom vehicle physics for arcade-style games that do not require high details and realism, avoiding all the complication of dealing with realistic vehicle physics. Itâ€™s a preferable path in making those kinds of games instead of starting with realistic physics and trying to trim it down to arcade, that usually brings a lot of problems specially when making a multiplayer game. This approach also gives full control of the physics and the ability to mutate it or even turn it off for special powers for example.
